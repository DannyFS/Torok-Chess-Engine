The Torok Chess Engine Project


Project Proposal:
- First we need to complete a working chess board representation with all rules applied correctly.
- Finding the best move:
  - Currently, this is the most challenging problem we need to face.
  - Brute forcing: due to the complications of the shannon number, brute forcing requires a large amount of hardware and time to evaluate steps that can be achieved through various other methods.
    This is not an ideal way to compute possible moves.
  - Diving in head first into the future:
    - To find the best move, we must dermine a lot of factors such as offense, defense, king's protection, pawn strcuture, winning positions, getting out of trouble, center control, etc.
  - Opening and endgame: These steps have been done for us and we can implement these databases into our engine. This leaves us with ~10 opening half-moves
    and checkmate opportunities using Syzygy Bases with 6 men (7 men available with 16.7TiB storage). Obviously having a secondary source of help throguh searching and evaluation will help with
    keeping the game under control. This leaves us to do the dirty work in the middle game which is very critical. Having a solid opening will improve our chances at managing the middle game.
- Hardware to use:
  - Currently I have a desktop running Windows 10, an i5-4460 and 16GB ddr3 1600mhz memory. 
  - Future hardware may require a 32+ core cpu, 1TB+ ddr4 ecc memory, and multiple nvidia tesla p100's.
- Absolute goal: find the fastest way to achieve checkmate while maintaining strong defensive play.
